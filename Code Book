The fields below, and definitions given, are the contained in the file "ActivityDataSummarized.txt", which is the 
final output of program run_analysis.r. 

The data represents the result of a series of transformations in that R script, which have created in a TIDY data set, 
due to a series of transformations resulting in data which has each measured variable is in 1 column, each different 
observation of that column is in a different row; there is a single table for each kind of variable, and when mutliple 
tables are used to create data across different types of data, there is abn explicit unique linking key column. 

Additionally, data is tidy when column names are functionally descriptive and have few if any special characters.

The original data above for the project was not tidy. I made it so by the following transformational steps:
                                          1. Applying descriptive (instead of numeric) column headers to all fields, based on 
                                            the feature name data provided with the project data in a separate file.
                                          2. Removing columns not defined by the project criterion (via grep and grepl text functions.)
                                          3. Replacing numeric codes with descriptve text for the various user activities.
                                          4. Removing all abbraviations for the measure field names, so that each field name
                                             included the complete word describing the type of measurement it represented.
                                          5. Summarizing for all categorical fields separately, to infrom the output with these 
                                             categories as distinct factors.
                                          

The result are the fields below, which include their value definitions.

                                                6 LAYING

-MEASURE VARIABLES
The following 78 fields are the average value for each of the level combinations of the categorical fields above, 
for the measures defined in the project documentation to be considered - namely, each type of technical device measurement 
(see below for these) which in the original data set included mean and standard devisation of a measure's time-spand summary.
The technical devices and other specifications which encompass all the field measures were as follows:
                                              
                                              The accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals , in coordinates X, Y, and Z.
                                              
                                              These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time.) 
                                              
                                              The acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals, 
                                              which were also separated into X,Y,and Z space cooridnates. 

                                              Body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals 
                                              
                                              Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm.

                                              Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

Each combination of these types of measurement and techical device orientation of the activities captured as signals, were used to 
estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern: '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

To summarize, the combinations features below measure either acceleramoter or gyroscope meaures of body movement in 3-dimsional space, 
either as the upward force of the body, or as the effec of gravity, and also include jerk, and also frequency signals via a fast fourier
transfer. And the original data set included summary metrics over a period of time, so these data have either mean or standard deviations
as sumamry types. 

From each combination of these measurements, the 78 measure fields below werer detrived. And Because of the tidying of the data set, 
all of these aspects of the measrements are captured in the name of the fields. And finally, the summary at the categorical level as defined above
was applied to the data as just defined.

So from the final summary, the mean of each value was taken for each level.
